        “Content is the king and Context is the Kingdom”- Market and business context always drives my commitment to Intellectual Property (IP) alignment for the organization's success.

Connecting dots with integrated Analytics with Patent, Market, Legal and Literature data to find whitespace and serve the business strategy.

Purpose driven company culture provides me great energy and scope for innovation.
